<h2 dir="ltr">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This document describes how to configure the Unversal&nbsp;Sensor so that the software matches the Lora hardware and the sensor used. That means that&nbsp;pin definitiona should describe the correct connections between&nbsp;the chip and the Lora transceiver and that the config.h file should describes what sensors are present and how they are connected to the board.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are two ways to configure the LoRa node:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set system configuration to make the node known to the system and get it compiled and buikt</li>
  <li>Make modifications to the config.h file and set parameters</li>
  <li>Use OTA communication to send downlink commands to the Universal Sensor</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all we will concentrate on configuration items to get the device mcu known to the system and compiled. After that, we will focus on the selecting the right sensor and get output of these sensors. Finally, we will focus on sending downlink command to the node while operational and change its configuration on the fly.</p>
