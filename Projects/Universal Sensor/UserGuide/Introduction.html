<h2 dir="ltr">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">These documents contain the documentation for the Universal Sensor code. There are LoRa sensors in different types and sizes. Apart from the sensor itself they differ mostly in power usage amd local storage capacity. There are sensor in the collowing types:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Based on Ardino Pro-Mini</li>
  <li>Based on ESP8266 or ESP32 technology</li>
  <li>Base on Cube-Cell (Heltec)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Sensors based on Arduino</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This is the oldest form of Lora Sensors that I used. For Arduino most sensors were already available, so the focus was on finding a Lora stack that worked in the available amount of memory and did not consume too much power.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Sensors based on ESP</h2>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Sensors based on Cube-Cell</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In october 2019 Heltec started with the Cube-Cell sensor initiative. For this they dod nof only offer an Arduino IDE interface with development board but also delivered a &quot;capsule&quot; device with internal antenna, interface for a battry and solarcells. It could work for several months on a battery and would have more memory available for sensor development.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Not Used Technology</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Of course there are more mcu's available to build Lora sensors with. Some even have far better specs than the Arduinos. However, power usage of the Arduino is minimal and LoRa sensors do not need much coding and/or power so the Arduino was used for sensors for a long time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please look on conrad or Aliexpress to find more mcu's supported.</p>
