<h2>USB Cabling</h2>
<p>USB cabling for the 1ch Gateway is really simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure your PC acceps USB devices and recorgnizes them</li>
  <li>Make sure the you have a good cable that not only connects the power-supply but can also be used by the Serial Port.</li>
  <li>Although long cables seem to work good, as well as cheap cables from Aliexpress, please use a well known Micro USB cable of one of your mobile phones first so you are sure the cable works OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all goes well, and you have more than one gateway connected you can use color coding to distinguish between cables and gateways etc.</p>
