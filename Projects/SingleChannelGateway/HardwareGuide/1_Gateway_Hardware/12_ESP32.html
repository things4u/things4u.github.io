<h2>Making an ESP32 Single Channel Gateway</h2>
<p>(c) Maarten Westenberg (mw12554@hotmail.com)</p>
<p>This is the second part of the hardware building instruction for the ESP Single Channel Gateway. This part deals with the ESP32 hardware and is both simpler than the previous ESP8266 and a little bit more pricy as well.</p>
<p>Several items to be bought from for example Aliexpress are ready to use. You should however use the correct PIN settings to make the board usable. PIN 4 is most used.</p>
