<h1>The 1 Channel Gateway</h1>
<p>Version: 1.0 draft<br>
  date: 
March 25, 2016</p>
<p>(c) Maarten Westenberg (mw12554@hotmail.com)</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A regular gateway for thethingsnetwork or LoRaWAN is capable of managing 10&nbsp;frequency channels and 20,000 devices (according to specs). For that, a special chip is needed, the SX1301 of Semtech which is both powerful and expensive and determines for a large deal the performance and price of LoRA backend devices.</p>
<p>In December 2015 Thomas Telkamp published a single channel gateway on forum.thethingsnetwork.org It was published as a proof of concept: Is it possible to make a single channel gateway on cheap hardware, making use of only a LoRa transceiver board (like the RFM95) and a cheap Linux computer. So I decided to make one myself as it allows easy testing of the gateway in a particular location.&nbsp;Since I do&nbsp;have a few Arduino type B (old model) boards and am slowly updating them to model 2 (and 3) I did have an Arduino with matching case available for this project.</p>
<p>Remember: This is a proof of concept project and by no means an official LoRa Gateway, the project is described and presented AS-IS! And although it works fine now, neither me (nor Thomas I am sure) will guarantee that the hardware or software is fit for a particular purpose, no warrantee is offered and we do not provide any future upgrade or patches.</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>First of all, we have to mount the RFM95 on an adapter board. There are no dedicated adapter boards available for this transceiver but the board for ESP8266 is quite good usable. Do not forget to remove the three small resistors (in the picture on the other side of the board). This small (white) board is sold for about $2.50 per lot of  10 boards. </p>
<p>As an alternative, OshPark makes/sells a really nice adapter board for the RFM95 at a very competitive price. It would mean even less soldering to get&nbsp;that one working on your RaspberryPI.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then make a board for the RaspberryPI. I decided to mount the RFM adapter board upside down, this makes the wiring a LOT easier&nbsp;as all soldering points are on the same side of the board.</p>

<p>Fortunately I did have a case available as well. It was used for another project first so there is a hole on top, but otherwise it is a nice fit.</p>

<p>You have to cut away some plastic of the case in order to make the antenna and SMA interface fit.</p>

<h2>Pin Connections</h2>
<p>The following connections must be made for the Gateway between RFM95 and the RaspberryPI. As we will mount the RFM95 upside down on the connection board that attaches to the P1 connector of the RaspberryPI, it will make our life simple if all connections are made on the odd pin numbers of the P1 connector. So we choose pin 9 for the GND connection instead of the default pin 6. </p>

<h6><em>* If we connect NSS to pin 15 instead of pin 22 on the connector, we should also modify the main.cpp file&nbsp;with that pin definition. The first gateway I made was connected to pin 22, the second I plan to only connect to odd pins.</em></h6>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>In order to get the singe channel gateway to work you have to load the software onto a RaspberryPI. Any Raspberry will do, and since the Gateway has not so many things to do, the old Raspi's might be the better choice as their power consumption is (much) lower.</p>
<p>There are MANY how-to install your RaspberryPI pages on the internet, so I will keep mine to an absolute minimum. Please refer to one of these many places if you need more information or help. The simplified process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the latest Linux distro on the RaspberryPI
    <ol>
      <li>Format a memory card of at least 8GB capacity (larger IS really better) using the SDformatter program</li>
      <li>Download the latest Jessie Linux distro from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">raspberrypi.org</a></li>
      <li>Use Win32Diskmanager to write the Linux image to the newly formatted memory card</li>
      <li>Put the disk in the Raspberry, connect power, connect a LAN cable and let the system boot up</li>
      <li>When the system is started, it is assigned an IP address, use that IP address to login to the Raspberry  (for example with PuTTY). login is pi and password is raspberry</li>
      <li>run the command: <em><strong>sudo raspi-config</strong></em>. Use the menu to expand memory system, set the hostname, set the password for pi user, set the timezone (clock), and disable device tree.</li>
      <li>If you want the Raspberry to connect wireless, insert a simple WiFI USB dongle and configure the file /etc/wpa-supplicant/wpa-supplicant.conf with the command: <em><strong>sudo nano  /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</strong></em><strong></strong> and add your own network. Change the &lt;YOURXX&gt; part with your own network settings:<br>
        <br>
        network={<br>
ssid=&quot;&lt;YOURSSID&gt;&quot;<br>
scan_ssid=0<br>
psk=&quot;&lt;YOURPASS&gt;&quot;<br>
proto=RSN<br>
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK<br>
pairwise=CCMP<br>
auth_alg=OPEN<br>
}<br>
      </li>
      <li>After that reboot your RaspberryPI to start with all new settings.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Install the 1-channel software on your RaspberryPI
    <ol>
      <li>Download the 1-channel software from Thomas' github site (see link below)</li>
      <li>Use FTP to your raspberry if necessary</li>
      <li>'make' the software.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Add some housekeeping commands
    <ol>
      <li>Add the Gateway to the crontab, so that it is restarted at regular intervals if necessary</li>
      <li>Add a log-file cleanup utility, and let it run every night (crontab)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The following links contain useful information for this project.</p>
<ul>

  <li><a href="http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org/t/single-channel-gateway/798">The forum of thethingsnetwork on this subject</a></li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>I think we all ask the same questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If we would build 10 of 1-channel gateways, would we then be able to effectively build the real 10-channel thing?</li>
  <li>What functions are we missing apart from the multi-channel support</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>There are some things to remember however:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The antenna is the same as the antenna used for regular nodes (cheap) so possible the range is the same as well. For better results: Buy a better antenna.</li>
  <li>Only one channel: Since nodes transmit on 10 channels and on a different channel every&nbsp;message this means that only one out of 10 messages is received using this gateway</li>
  <li>In the software of Thomas, the host&nbsp;identification of croft is still a byte code (better allow hostname or DNS). I built a version that will accept DNS host names, contact me if you need it.</li>
</ul>
