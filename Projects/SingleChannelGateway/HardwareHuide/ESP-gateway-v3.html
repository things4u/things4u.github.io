<h1>ESP LoRa Gateway v3</h1>
<p>Version: 3.3.0 version<br>
  date: January 12, 2017</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the version 3.2 (and newer) version of the ESP8266 LoRa Gateway. The&nbsp;LoRa gateway based n the ESP8266 mcu has evolved a lot over the last year. Although all versions that&nbsp;I built are/were built using the Wemos D1-mini board that can be bought on Aliexperess amongst others, the system has changed. For the latest version of the gateway I make use of the PCB that has been designed and built by Charles Hallard (and can be bought from pcbs.io).</p>
<p>Other PCB's work as well, but if you like to build a small gateway and&nbsp;keep as many GPIO pins available as well, the Hallard board is unbeatable. You have to remember though that dio0, dio1 and dio2 pins are multiplexed on the board using (very!) small diodes to GPIO pin 15 (D8).</p>
<p>The project source code is found on&nbsp;the <a href="https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway">Things4U github page</a>.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>A full-function gateway is capable of simultaneously receive several LoRa packets with various spreading factors on random channels. The 1-channel gateway does not have the performance to do all that. It is sort of compatible with the LoRa data format sent by sensors but it does not implement the rest of the LoRa specs and therefore is not compliant.<br>
The 1-channel gateway has the following limitations compared to its bigger brother:</p>
<ol>
  <li>1-channel only: So 1 out of every 8 message on average is received. If you do not have any other gateways in production I advise you to use channel 0 for this purpose.</li>
  <li>Works with one Spreading Factor mode only (SF7 is activated by default at the moment).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>As you can see on the picture above, the whole thing fits on a very small board. And as there are even less connections necessary as for the loRa node, this DIY project could be ready in a matter of hours. These are the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Solder pin's to the Wemos D1-mini and the small white ESP adapter board.<br>
    <br>

  <li><br>
  </li>
  <li>push the ESP adapter board in one of those experiment bread boards (So it cools the pins when soldering)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> above.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Solder the antenna SMA connector close to the antenna pin and connect the center pin and the ground pins (bottom).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Connect the RFM and the ESP with small pieces of wire as indicated in the &quot;connections&quot; table below.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did not yet find a nice box to put the gateway in, but that will probably not last very long.</p>
<h2>RFM95 Pin Out</h2>
<p>The pin out of the two devices on the gateway board are as follows:</p>

<p>The pin-out of the ESP8266 is as follows (note: There are differences in pin-out between the various ESP8266 devices)</p>

<p>Connections need&nbsp;to be made as follows:</p>

<p>* The reset pin does not have to be connected so it seems. It is only used at setup to read the chip identification</p>
<p>As you can see, both reset and GPIO0 of the ESP8266 are not used. Not connecting the last one makes the ESP8266 gateway more stable and the behavior between flash and normal mode is the same.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>The software is currently still under development. Several additions have been made to the RaspberryPI version in order to make this ESP version more reliable and workable. However, there are still some functions that can be included such as&nbsp;setting the SSID and password dynamically&nbsp;(The ESP will act as an access point so that your PC can connect to it, and set SSID and Password).</p>
<h3>DNS</h3>
<p>The ESP libraries support DNS hostnames out of the box. As apparently DNS functions are hard on the mcu, and may cause  crashes and watchdog resets, I have decided to only once get the IP address of the LoRa router and from that moment on use that IP address in the program.</p>
<h3>Clock</h3>
<p>The clock function is implemented using NTP. As soon as we have an IP connection we try to connect to a timeserver to get the current time. This way we know how long the unit is operational since we last powered it on, and can we time things if necessary.</p>
<h3>Webserver </h3>
<p>As the ESP8266 is not a Linux machine, so it has no local persistent storage (disk), at least not out of the box. It also lacks the possibility to make a SSH connection as you can with a RaspberryPI for example. Still we would like to know how the device is doing, and how long it is operating without any problems. The latter is easy to measure if we look at the time that the gateway is operational. If that time is after the moment we plugged the gateway in, it probably suffered from a Watchdog reset and has restarted since.</p>
<p>Although watchdogs are not OK, they are an integral part of the ESP8266 design. The chip will reset in a very short amount of time so&nbsp;in principle we would not lose too many incoming packets (if any). However, since we will loose statistics data and probably the channel and WIFI setting as well if we make that dynamically, it would be better if we would not have ANY watchdog resets.</p>
<p>Over the last week, both gateways have been running fine without any resets. So I had to add a date field in the webserver as well, since &quot;started on Friday&quot; would not give enough information at all.</p>
<p>I built following webserver to view statistics and control debug level, channel assignment (future) etc. You can easily invoke the webserver at the IP address of the Gateway as follows: http://&lt;IP Address of Gateway&gt;:8080. The output looks like this. The interface also allows some setting of debug levels and statistics. More to come..</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>I think we all ask the same questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What mode of the Gateway to use for my application </li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>There are some things to remember however:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The antenna is the same as the antenna used for regular nodes (cheap) so possible the range is the same as well. For better results: Buy a better antenna.</li>
  <li>Only one channel: Since nodes often transmit on 10 channels and on a different channel every&nbsp;message this means that only one out of 10 messages is received using this gateway</li>
  <li>In the software of Thomas, the host&nbsp;identification of croft is still a byte code (better allow hostname or DNS). The ESP version  does accept DNS host names.</li>
</ul>
