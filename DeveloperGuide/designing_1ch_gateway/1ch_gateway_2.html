<h1>Gateway software</h1>
<p>This document describes in more detail the design considerations for a 1-channel gateway software. The TTN server-gateway-node communication is according to the document made by Semtech. Although everybody is free to implement his/her own communication protocol for gateway communication, this document will adhere to the standard set by Semtech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Several versions have been designed of the single channel gateway software&nbsp;for the ESP8266. The hardware description and build instructions are found in the <a href="../../HardwareGuide/hardware_guide.html">Hardware Guide</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Basic Operation</h2>
<p>The following functions must be performed by the gateway:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forward PUSH messages received from LoRa nodes to the backend</li>
  <li>Send periodical STAT message to the server with information about the gateway status and statistics</li>
  <li>Send PULL REQUEST message to the server where it asks for downlink messages to send. These PULL_REQUEST messages also serve as a keep-alive type of message for the server (unlike the STAT messages);</li>
  <li>Several ACK message to confirm messsage receipt to the server</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
